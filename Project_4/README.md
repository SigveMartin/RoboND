# Required Steps to complete this project:

* Clone the project repo [here](https://github.com/udacity/RoboND-DeepLearning-Project.git)
* Fill out the TODO's in the project code as mentioned [here](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd209/parts/c199593e-1e9a-4830-8e29-2c86f70f489e/modules/cac27683-d5f4-40b4-82ce-d708de8f5373/lessons/197a058e-44f6-47df-8229-0ce633e0a2d0/concepts/b0044631-d356-4ff4-9fd9-4102c28a2efa?contentVersion=1.0.0&contentLocale=en-us)
* Optimize your network and hyper-parameters.
* Train your network and achieve an accuracy of 40% (0.40) using the Intersection over Union IoU metric which is final_grade_score at the bottom of your notebook.
* Make a brief writeup report summarizing why you made the choices you did in building the network.

The submission includes 

* [model_training.ipynb](https://github.com/SigveMartin/RoboND/blob/master/Project_4/submission/model_training.ipynb)
* [model_training.html](https://github.com/SigveMartin/RoboND/blob/master/Project_4/submission/model_training.html)
* [config_model_weights.h5](https://github.com/SigveMartin/RoboND/blob/master/Project_4/submission/config_model_weights.h5)
* [model_weights.h5](https://github.com/SigveMartin/RoboND/blob/master/Project_4/submission/model_weights.h5)

and the whole project folder together with this write-up / README and its images. 


## [Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/1155/view) Points
### Here I will consider the rubric points individually and describe how I addressed each point in my implementation.  

---
### Writeup / README

#### Provide a Writeup / README that includes all the rubric points and how you addressed each one.  You can submit your writeup as markdown or pdf.  

You're reading it!

### Network Architecture 

#### Maybe as sub sections of architecture

* 1x1 vs fully connected layer... 
* various uses of encoding/decoding images - when it should be used, when its useful, and any problems that may arise. 
* The student is able to clearly articulate whether this model and data would work well for following another object (dog, cat, car, etc.) instead of a human and if not, what changes would be required.
