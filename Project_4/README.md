# Required Steps to complete this project:

Clone the project repo here
Fill out the TODO's in the project code as mentioned here
Optimize your network and hyper-parameters.
Train your network and achieve an accuracy of 40% (0.40) using the Intersection over Union IoU metric which is final_grade_score at the bottom of your notebook.
Make a brief writeup report summarizing why you made the choices you did in building the network.
